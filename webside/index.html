        <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
        <p>Football, known as soccer in some countries, is a dynamic and exhilarating sport played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective is simple yet challenging: to score goals by getting a ball into the opposing team’s net, using any part of the body except the hands and arms. Played on a rectangular field, football emphasizes teamwork, strategy, and skill, with players utilizing dribbling, passing, and shooting to outmaneuver opponents. It’s the world’s most popular sport, with a global following that unites millions of fans in stadiums and in front of televisions. From local leagues to the grandeur of international tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, football’s universal appeal transcends language, culture, and borders, making it a true global phenomenon.</p>
